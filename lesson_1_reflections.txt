How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes me see the differences and help to figure out where the problem is

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Over time you need to have a sense of what you have done before. Sometimes you need to change your work or undo it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is better, because you have a sense about what you changed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is fine

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log and git diff to see what happened

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I could bring them back, it shouldn't be a problem anymore

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my work
